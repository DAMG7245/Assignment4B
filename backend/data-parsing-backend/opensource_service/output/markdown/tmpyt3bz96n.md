NOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies
Basis of Presentation
The  accompanying  unaudited  condensed  consolidated  financial  statements  were  prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally
accepted in the United States of America, or U.S. GAAP, for interim financial information and with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of
Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, Regulation S-X. The January 26, 2020 consolidated balance sheet was derived from our audited
consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020, as filed with the SEC, but
does  not  include  all  disclosures  required  by  U.S.  GAAP.  In  the  opinion  of  management,  all  adjustments,  consisting  only  of  normal  recurring
adjustments considered necessary for a fair statement of results of operations and financial position have been included. The results for the interim
periods presented are not necessarily indicative of the results expected for any future period. The following information should be read in conjunction
with  the  audited  consolidated  financial  statements  and  notes  thereto  included  in  our  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  for  the  fiscal  year  ended
January 26, 2020.  
Significant Accounting Policies
There have been no material changes to our significant accounting policies in Note 1 - Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,
of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.
Fiscal Year
We operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal year 2021 is a 53-week year and fiscal year 2020 is a 52-week
year. The first quarters of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were both 13-week quarters.
Reclassifications
Certain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.
Principles of Consolidation
Our condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany
balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we
evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue recognition, cash equivalents and marketable securities, accounts receivable, inventories,
income  taxes,  goodwill,  stock-based  compensation,  litigation,  investigation  and  settlement  costs,  restructuring  and  other  charges,  and  other
contingencies.  The  inputs  into  our  judgments  and  estimates  consider  the  economic  implications  of  COVID-19  on  our  critical  and  significant
accounting estimates. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.
Adoption of New and Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement
In  June  2016,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board  issued  a  new  accounting  standard  to  replace  the  existing  incurred  loss  impairment
methodology with a methodology that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable
information to inform credit loss estimates for accounts receivable and other financial instruments, including available-for-sale debt securities. The
Company adopted the standard in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and the impact of the adoption was not material to the Company's consolidated
financial statements.

value of approximately $7.0 billion in cash on April 27, 2020.
Note 3 - Leases
Our lease obligations consist of operating leases for our headquarters complex, domestic and international office facilities, and data center space,

Note 6 – Income Taxes
We recognized an income tax expense of $64 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and income tax benefit of $5 million for the first quarter
of fiscal year 2020. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax was 6.6% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and
income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 1.3% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020.
The increase in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a
decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.
Our effective tax rates for the first quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 were lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% due to income earned
in jurisdictions that are subject to taxes lower than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate, tax benefits related to stock-based compensation, and the
benefit of the U.S. federal research tax credit.
For the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, there have been no material changes to our tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax
jurisdictions. Additionally, there have been no material changes to our unrecognized tax benefits and any related interest or penalties since the fiscal
year ended January 26, 2020.
While we believe that we have adequately provided for all uncertain tax positions, or tax positions where we believe it is not more-likely-than-not that
the position will be sustained upon review, amounts asserted by tax authorities could be greater or less than our accrued position. Accordingly, our
provisions on federal, state and foreign tax related matters to be recorded in the future may change as revised estimates are made or the underlying
matters are settled or otherwise resolved with the respective tax authorities. As of April 26, 2020, we do not believe that our estimates, as otherwise
provided for, on such tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months.

for all periods presented. For the first quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, net realized gains were not significant.
Note 8 – Fair Value of Financial Assets and Liabilities
The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar
assets from active markets. We review fair value hierarchy classification on a quarterly basis.

Revenue related to remaining performance obligations represents the amount of contracted license and development arrangements and PCS that
has  not  been  recognized.  This  includes  related  deferred  revenue  currently  recorded  and  amounts  that  will  be  invoiced  in  future  periods.  As  of
April 26, 2020, the amount of our remaining performance obligations that has not been recognized as revenue was $389 million, of which we expect
to recognize approximately 47% as revenue over the next twelve months and the remainder thereafter. This amount excludes the value of remaining
performance obligations for contracts with an original expected length of one year or less.
Note 11 - Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating expenses.
These contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for hedge accounting treatment. Gains or losses on the contracts are recorded in accumulated
other  comprehensive  income  or  loss  and reclassified  to  operating  expense  when the  related  operating  expenses  are  recognized  in  earnings  or
ineffectiveness should occur. The fair value of the contracts was not significant as of April 26, 2020 and January 26, 2020.
We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of foreign currency movements on monetary assets and liabilities that
are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These forward contracts were not designated for hedge accounting treatment. Therefore,
the change in fair value of these contracts is recorded in other income or expense and offsets the change in fair value of the hedged foreign currency
denominated monetary assets and liabilities, which is also recorded in other income or expense.
The table below presents the notional value of our foreign currency forward contracts outstanding as of April 26, 2020 and January 26, 2020:

During the first quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, the impact of derivative financial instruments designated for hedge accounting treatment on
other comprehensive income or loss was not significant and all such instruments were determined to be highly effective. Therefore, there were no
gains or losses associated with ineffectiveness.

Note 12 - Debt
Long-Term Debt
In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes
Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. Interest on the March 2020 Notes is payable on
April 1 and October 1 of each year, beginning on October 1, 2020. Upon 30 days' notice to holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash
prior  to  maturity,  at  redemption  prices  that  include  accrued  and  unpaid  interest,  if  any,  and  a  make-whole  premium.  However,  no  make-whole
premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2030 on or after January 1, 2030, the Notes Due 2040 on or after October 1, 2039, the Notes
Due 2050 on or after October 1, 2049, or the Notes Due 2060 on or after October 1, 2059. The net proceeds from the March 2020 Notes were
$4.97 billion, after deducting debt discount and estimated issuance costs.
In  September  2016,  we  issued  $1.00  billion  of  the  2.20%  Notes  Due  2021  and  $1.00  billion  of  the  3.20%  Notes  Due  2026,  or  collectively,  the
September 2016 Notes. Interest on the September 2016 Notes is payable on March 16 and September 16 of each year. Upon 30 days' notice to
holders of the Notes, we may redeem the Notes for cash prior to maturity, at redemption prices that include accrued and unpaid interest, if any, and
a make-whole premium. However, no make-whole premium will be paid for redemptions of the Notes Due 2021 on or after August 16, 2021, or for
redemptions of the Notes Due 2026 on or after June 16, 2026. The net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting
debt discount and issuance costs.
Both the September 2016 Notes and the March 2020 Notes, or collectively, the Notes, are our unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right
of payment with all existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our
subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. All
existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries will be effectively senior to the Notes.

Purchase Obligations
As of April 26, 2020, we had outstanding inventory purchase obligations totaling $1.76 billion and other purchase obligations totaling $287 million.
Accrual for Product Warranty Liabilities
The  estimated  amount  of  product  returns  and  warranty  liabilities  was  $16  million  and  $15  million  as  of  April  26,  2020  and  January  26,  2020,
respectively, and the activities related to the warranty liabilities were not significant.
In connection with certain agreements that we have entered in the past, we have provided indemnities to cover the indemnified party for matters
such  as  tax,  product,  and  employee  liabilities.  We  have  included  intellectual  property  indemnification  provisions  in  our  technology  related
agreements with third parties. Maximum potential future payments cannot be estimated because many of these agreements do not have a maximum
stated liability. We have not recorded any liability in our Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for such indemnifications.
Litigation
Securities Class Action and Derivative Lawsuits
On December 21, 2018, a purported securities class action lawsuit was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California,
captioned Iron Workers Joint Funds v. Nvidia Corporation, et al. (Case No. 18-cv-7669), naming as defendants NVIDIA and certain of NVIDIA’s
officers.  On  December  28,  2018,  a  substantially  similar  purported  securities  class  action  was  commenced  in  the  Northern  District  of  California,
captioned  Oto  v.  Nvidia  Corporation,  et  al.  (Case  No.  18-cv-07783),  naming  the  same  defendants,  and  seeking  substantially  similar  relief.  On
February 19, 2019, a number of shareholders filed motions to consolidate the two cases and to be appointed lead plaintiff and for their respective
counsel to be appointed lead counsel. On March 12, 2019, the two cases were consolidated under case number 4:18-cv-07669-HSG and titled In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation. On May 2, 2019, the Court appointed lead plaintiffs and lead counsel. On June 21, 2019, the lead plaintiffs
filed  a  consolidated  class  action  complaint.  The  consolidated  complaint  asserts  that  the  defendants  violated  Section  10(b)  of  the  Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, and SEC Rule 10b-5, by making materially false or misleading statements related to
channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand between May 10, 2017 and November 14, 2018. The plaintiffs also
allege that the NVIDIA executives who they named as defendants violated Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek class certification,
an award of unspecified compensatory damages, an award of reasonable costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees and expert fees, and further
relief as the Court may deem just and proper. On August 2, 2019, NVIDIA moved to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint on the basis
that plaintiffs failed to state any claims for violations of the securities laws by NVIDIA or the named defendants. On March 16, 2020, the Court issued
an order dismissing the consolidated class action complaint with leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on May 13, 2020.
On January 18, 2019, a shareholder, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed a derivative lawsuit in the Northern District of California, captioned
Han v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 19-cv-00341), seeking to assert claims on behalf of NVIDIA against the members of NVIDIA’s board of directors and
certain officers. The lawsuit asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, waste of corporate assets, and violations of Sections
14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false and misleading statements related to channel inventory
and  the  impact  of  cryptocurrency  mining  on  GPU  demand.  The  plaintiff  is  seeking  unspecified  damages  and  other  relief,  including  reforms  and
improvements to NVIDIA’s corporate governance and internal procedures. On February 12, 2019, a substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed
in the Northern District of California captioned Yang v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 19-cv-00766), naming the same named defendants, and seeking the
same relief. On February 19, 2019, a third substantially similar derivative lawsuit was filed in the Northern District of California captioned The Booth
Family Trust v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 3:19-cv-00876), naming the same named defendants, and seeking substantially the same relief. On March
12, 2019, the three derivative actions were consolidated under case number 4:19-cv-00341-HSG, and titled In re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated
Derivative Litigation. The Court approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the

In Re NVIDIA Corporation Consolidated Derivative Litigation pending resolution of any motion to dismiss that NVIDIA may file in the In Re NVIDIA
Corporation Securities Litigation.
On September 24, 2019, two shareholders, purporting to act on behalf of NVIDIA, filed two identical lawsuits in the District of Delaware. One is
captioned Lipchitz v. Huang, et al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01795-UNA) and the other is captioned Nelson v. Huang, et. al. (Case No. 1:19-cv-01798-
UNA). The lawsuits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, insider trading, misappropriation of information, corporate waste
and violations of Sections 14(a), 10(b), and 20(a) of the Exchange Act based on the dissemination of allegedly false, and misleading statements
related to channel inventory and the impact of cryptocurrency mining on GPU demand. The plaintiffs seek unspecified damages and other relief,
including disgorgement of profits from the sale of NVIDIA stock and unspecified corporate governance measures. On December 11, 2019, the Court
approved the parties’ stipulation to stay the Lipchitz and Huang actions pending resolution of the motion to dismiss filed by NVIDIA in the In Re
NVIDIA Corporation Securities Litigation.
It is possible that additional suits will be filed, or allegations received from shareholders, with respect to these same or other matters, naming NVIDIA
and/or its officers and directors as defendants.
Accounting for Loss Contingencies
We are engaged in legal actions not described above arising in the ordinary course of business and, while there can be no assurance of favorable
outcomes, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial
position. As of April 26, 2020, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with the legal proceedings described above
based on our belief that liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, except as specifically described above, any possible loss or range of
loss in these matters cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.
Note 14 - Shareholders’ Equity  
Capital Return Program 
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
Through April 26, 2020, we have repurchased an aggregate of 260 million shares under our share repurchase program for a total cost of $7.08
billion. All shares delivered from these repurchases  have been placed into treasury  stock.  As of April 26, 2020, we were authorized,  subject  to
certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid $98 million in cash dividends to our shareholders.
Note 15 - Segment Information
Our Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information presented on an
operating  segment  basis  for  purposes  of  making  decisions  and  assessing  financial  performance.  Previously,  we  had  reported  two  operating
segments: GPU and Tegra Processor. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we changed our operating segments to be consistent with the
revised manner in which our CODM reviews our financial performance and allocates resources. The two new operating segments are "Graphics"
and  "Compute  &  Networking".  Comparative  periods  presented  reflect  this  change.  Our  operating  segments  are  equivalent  to  our  reportable
segments.
Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and
solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive
platforms for infotainment systems. Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for artificial intelligence, or AI,
high performance computing, or HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous vehicles; and Jetson for robotics and other embedded
platforms.
Operating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged
across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.

The “All Other” category includes the expenses that our CODM does not assign to either Graphics or Compute & Networking for purposes of making
operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and
support costs, acquisition-related costs, legal settlement costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise
in nature.
Our CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly
attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and
amortization  expense  by  operating  segment  and,  therefore,  it  is  not  separately  presented.  There  is  no  intersegment  revenue.  The  accounting
policies  for  segment  reporting  are  the  same  as  for  our  consolidated  financial  statements.  The  table  below  presents  details  of  our  reportable
segments and the “All Other” category.

Overview
Our Company and Our Businesses
NVIDIA pioneered accelerated computing to help solve the most challenging computational problems. Starting with a focus on PC graphics, we
extended our focus in recent years to the revolutionary field of AI. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the
gaming market, NVIDIA leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for virtual reality, HPC, and AI.
Through fiscal year 2020, our reportable segments were GPU and Tegra Processor. Starting with the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, our reportable
segments have changed to "Graphics" and "Compute & Networking".
Our Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and
solutions for gaming platforms; Quadro GPUs for enterprise design; GRID software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; and automotive
platforms for infotainment systems.
Our Compute & Networking segment includes Data Center platforms and systems for AI, HPC, and accelerated computing; DRIVE for autonomous
vehicles;  and  Jetson  for  robotics  and  other  embedded  platforms.  Starting  with  the  second  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2021,  we  will  include  Mellanox
revenue in this segment.
21

---
All  prior  period  comparisons  presented  reflect  our  new  reportable  segments.  Our  market  platforms  –  Gaming,  Professional  Visualization,  Data
Center, Automotive, OEM and Other – remain unchanged. We will incorporate Mellanox in our Data Center market platform.
Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.

Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges
COVID-19
The novel strain of the coronavirus identified in late calendar 2019 (COVID-19) has spread to a worldwide pandemic within the first quarter of fiscal
year 2021. Government  authorities around the world implemented  measures to try to contain the disease, such as travel  bans and restrictions,
quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. Since March 2020, most of our employees have been working remotely and we temporarily
prohibited business travel.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we experienced disruptions to our supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners
and component supply, primarily based in Asia. These disruptions adversely impacted our linearity of supply and sales within the quarter.
The shelter-in-place or similar global orders have impacted demand for our gaming products in many jurisdictions that rely on purchases at physical
retailers due to temporary store closures, and demand from iCafes located in China which have temporarily closed. In addition, the global demand
for automobiles has decreased during this time which negatively impacts demand for our automotive products and solutions. In some regions, the
shelter-in-place  orders  have  driven  a  temporary  increase  in  demand,  that  may  not  be  sustainable,  for  gaming,  OEM  platforms  and  compute
infrastructure as a result of work from home, learn at home, and gaming.
The full extent and duration of COVID-19 is uncertain. If the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period, the timing and overall demand
from customers and the availability of supply chain, logistical services and component supply could have a material net negative impact on our
business and financial results. Refer to Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q for additional information under the heading “Risk Factors”.

23

---
Automotive  revenue  was  $155  million,  down  7%  from  a  year  earlier  and  down  5%  sequentially,  primarily  reflecting  lower  legacy  infotainment
revenue.
OEM and Other revenue for the first quarter was $138 million, up 39% from a year ago and down 9% sequentially. The year-on-year increase was
primarily due to higher demand for entry level laptop GPUs from PC OEMs. The sequential decrease reflects seasonally lower sales of entry-level
GPUs for PC OEMs.
Gross margin for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 was 65.1%, up 670 basis points from a year earlier and up 20 basis points sequentially. The
year-on-year increase was primarily driven by GeForce GPU product mix and higher Data Center sales. The sequential increase was Data Center,
partially offset by product mix in GeForce GPUs.
Operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 were $1.03 billion, up 10% from a year earlier and flat sequentially. The year-on-year
growth primarily reflects employee additions and increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including stock-based compensation
and infrastructure costs.
Income from operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $976 million, up 173% from a year earlier and down 1% sequentially. Net income
for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 was $917 million. Net income per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 were $1.47, up 130%
from a year earlier and down 4% sequentially.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we paid dividends of $98 million. Due to the current market uncertainties, we are evaluating the timing of
resuming  share  repurchases  and  will remain  nimble  based  on  market  conditions.  We  are  currently  authorized  to  repurchase  up  to  $7.24  billion
through December 2022. We remain committed to paying quarterly dividends.
Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at the end of the first quarter were $16.35 billion, up from $7.80 billion a year earlier and $10.90
billion in the prior quarter, reflecting the issuance of $5 billion of March 2020 Notes and strong operating cash flow.
Subsequent  to  the  end  of  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2021,  we  closed  the  acquisition  of  Mellanox  for  a  transaction  value  of  approximately
$7.0 billion in cash on April 27, 2020.
Market Platform Highlights
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, in our Gaming platform, we launched Minecraft with RTX as an open beta on Windows 10; announced the

Graphics -  Graphics segment revenue increased 25% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, which
reflects growth in GeForce gaming and Quadro GPU revenue. Gaming increased 28%, reflecting revenue growth across all platforms. Revenue from
Quadro GPUs increased by 24%, reflecting strength in desktop and laptop workstations.
Compute & Networking -  Compute & Networking segment revenue increased 69% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first
quarter of fiscal year 2020, driven by an increase in data center-related sales for vertical industries and hyperscales.
Concentration of Revenue 
Revenue from sales to customers outside of the United States accounted for 84% and 93% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2021
and 2020, respectively. Revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially
billed even if the revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location.
No customer represented 10% or more of total revenue or the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. One customer represented 11% of our total revenue
for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 and was attributable primarily to the Graphics segment.

---
Gross Margin
Our overall gross margin increased to 65.1% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 from 58.4% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2020. The increase
in fiscal year 2021 is primarily driven by GeForce GPU product mix and higher data center sales.
Inventory provisions totaled $36 million and $43 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales of inventory that was
previously written-off or -down totaled $39 million and $12 million for the first quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. As a result, the
overall net effect on our gross margin was a favorable impact of 0.1% and unfavorable impact of 1.4% for the first quarter of fiscal years 2021 and
2020, respectively.
A discussion of our gross margin results for each of our reportable segments is as follows:
Graphics -  The gross margin of our Graphics segment increased during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first quarter of fiscal
year 2020, primarily driven by GeForce GPU product mix.
Compute  &  Networking  -  The  gross  margin  of  our  Compute  &  Networking  segment  increased  during  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2021
compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, primarily driven by higher data center sales.

Research and Development
Research and development expenses increased by 9% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020,
driven primarily by employee additions, increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-based
compensation expense.
Sales, General and Administrative
Sales, general and administrative expenses increased by 11% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, compared to the first quarter of fiscal year
2020, driven primarily by employee additions, increases in employee compensation and other related costs, including infrastructure costs and stock-
based compensation expense.
Other Income, Net
Interest Income and Interest Expense
Interest income consists of interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Interest income was $31 million and $44 million
during the first quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest earned on our
investments.
Interest expense is primarily comprised of coupon interest and debt discount amortization related to our September 2016 Notes and March 2020
Notes. Interest expense was $25 million and $13 million during the first quarters of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Income Taxes
We recognized an income tax expense of $64 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and an income tax benefit of $5 million for the first
quarter of fiscal year 2020. The income tax expense as a percentage of income before income tax
26

---
was 6.6% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 and income tax benefit as a percentage of income before income tax was 1.3% for the first quarter
of fiscal year 2020.
The increase in our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 as compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 was primarily due to a
decrease of tax benefits from stock-based compensation.

(225)  
As of April 26, 2020, we had $16.35 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, an increase of $5.46 billion from the end of fiscal
year 2020. Our investment policy requires the purchase of highly rated fixed income securities, the diversification of investment types and credit
exposures, and certain limits on our portfolio duration.
Cash provided by operating activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2020, due to higher
net income partially offset by changes in working capital. Change in working capital was driven by an increase in accounts receivable, an increase in
inventory, and changes in operating liabilities.
Cash used in investing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to cash provided in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020,
due to absence of maturities of marketable securities.
Cash provided by financing activities increased in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 compared to cash used in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020,
due to the debt issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2021.
Liquidity
Our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents, our marketable securities, and the cash generated by our operations. As of
April 26, 2020, we had $16.35 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our marketable securities consist of debt securities issued
by  the  U.S.  government  and  its  agencies,  highly  rated  corporations  and  financial  institutions,  and  certificates  of  deposits.  These  marketable
securities are denominated in United States dollars. Refer to Note 7 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for additional
information. We believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our operating requirements and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve
months. Subsequent to the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we used approximately $7.0 billion to close the Mellanox acquisition.
As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, substantially all of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held outside of the United States
as of April 26, 2020 are available for use in the United States without incurring additional U.S. federal income taxes.
Capital Return to Shareholders
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we returned $98 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of April 26, 2020, we were authorized, subject to
certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any
shares during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. Due to the
27

---
current market uncertainties, we are evaluating the timing of resuming share repurchases and will remain nimble based on market conditions. We
remain committed to paying quarterly dividends.
Our cash dividend program and the payment of future cash dividends under that program are subject to our Board's continuing determination that
the dividend program and the declaration of dividends thereunder are in the best interests of our shareholders.
Outstanding Indebtedness and Credit Facilities
In March 2020, we issued $1.50 billion of the 2.85% Notes Due 2030, $1.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes Due 2040, $2.00 billion of the 3.50% Notes
Due 2050, and $500 million of the 3.70% Notes Due 2060, or collectively, the March 2020 Notes. The net proceeds from the March 2020 Notes were
$4.97 billion, after deducting debt discounts and estimated issuance costs.
In  September  2016,  we  issued  $1.00  billion  of  the  2.20%  Notes  Due  2021  and  $1.00  billion  of  the  3.20%  Notes  Due  2026,  or  collectively,  the
September 2016 Notes. The net proceeds from the September 2016 Notes were $1.98 billion, after deducting debt discounts and issuance costs.
We  have  a  Credit  Agreement  under  which  we  may  borrow  up  to  $575  million  for  general  corporate  purposes  and  can  obtain  revolving  loan
commitments up to $425 million. As of April 26, 2020, we had not borrowed any amounts under this agreement.
We have a $575 million commercial paper program to support general corporate purposes. As of April 26, 2020, we had not issued any commercial
paper.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of April 26, 2020, we had no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable SEC regulations.
Contractual Obligations
There were no material changes in our contractual obligations from those disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended

ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Controls and Procedures
Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Based on their evaluation as of April 26, 2020, our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has concluded
that our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) were effective to
provide reasonable assurance.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the first quarter of fiscal year 2021 that have materially affected, or are
reasonably  likely  to  materially  affect,  our  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  despite  the  fact  that  virtually  all  of  our  employees  are  working
remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize
the impact on their operating effectiveness.
Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls
Our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or
our internal controls, will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable,
not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are
resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems,
no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within NVIDIA have been detected.
PART II. OTHER INFORMATION
ITEM 1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS
Refer to Part I, Item 1, Note 13 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of significant developments in our
legal proceedings since January 26, 2020. Also refer to Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 26, 2020 for a prior discussion of our legal proceedings.
ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS
Refer to the description of the risk factors associated with our business previously disclosed in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. Other than the risk factors listed below, there have been no material changes from the risk factors previously
described under Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020.
Before you buy our common stock, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks including, but not limited to, the risks
described in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 26, 2020. Additionally, any one of those risks could harm
our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations,  which  could  cause  our  stock  price  to  decline.  Additional  risks  and  uncertainties  not
presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.
The recent novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
The novel strain of the coronavirus identified in late calendar 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide, resulting in shutdowns of manufacturing and
commerce in the months that followed. Since then, COVID-19 has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to
contain the disease, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. Our corporate headquarters, and a
portion  of  our  research  and  development  activities  and  data  center  capacity,  are  located  in  California,  and  other  critical  business  operations,
including  most  of  our  finished  goods  inventory,  and  many  of  our  key  suppliers,  are  located  in  the  Asia  Pacific  Region.  We  have  development,
operations and employees in China, Hong Kong, India and Taiwan, and the Asia Pacific region represents an important end market for our products.
Our customers and suppliers within the Asia Pacific region are also affected by COVID-19 related restrictions and closures. These measures have
impacted, and may further
29

---
impact,  our  workforce  and  operations,  the  operations  of  our  customers  and  our  partners,  and  those  of  our  respective  vendors  and  suppliers
(including  our  subcontractors  and  third-party  contract  manufacturers).  For  example,  during  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2021,  we  experienced
disruptions to our supply chain and logistical services provided by outsourcing partners and component supply, primarily based in Asia. The shelter-
in-place or similar global orders have impacted demand for our gaming products in many jurisdictions that rely on purchases at physical retailers due
to  temporary  store  closures,  and  demand  from  iCafes  located  in  China  which  have  temporarily  closed.  In  addition,  the  global  demand  for
automobiles  has  decreased  during  this  time  which  negatively  impacts  demand  for  our  automotive  products  and  solutions.  In  some  regions,  the
shelter-in-place  orders  have  driven  a  temporary  increase  in  demand,  that  may  not  be  sustainable,  for  gaming,  OEM  platforms  and  compute
infrastructure as a result of work from home, learn at home, and gaming.
The manufacture of product components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic
locations, including Taiwan, China, Hong Kong and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through
Hong  Kong.  Each  of  these  countries  has  been  affected  by  the  pandemic  and  has  taken  measures  to  try  to  contain  it.  There  is  considerable
uncertainty regarding the impact of such measures and potential future measures, including restrictions on manufacturing facilities, on our support
operations  or  workforce,  or  on  our  customers,  partners,  vendors  and  suppliers.  Such  measures,  as  well  as  restrictions  or  disruptions  of
transportation, such as reduced availability or increased cost of air transport, port closures and increased border controls or closures, could limit our
capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
The  spread  of  COVID-19  has  caused  us  to  modify  our  business  practices  (including  employee  travel,  mandatory  work-from-home  policies  and
cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as required by government authorities
or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and suppliers. There is no certainty that such measures will be
sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the disease, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.
In addition, while the extent and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and our business in particular is difficult to assess or
predict, the pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, significant disruption of global financial markets, which may reduce our ability to
access capital or our customers’ ability to pay us for past or future purchases, which could negatively affect our liquidity. The COVID-19 pandemic
could also reduce the demand for our products. In addition, a recession or financial market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could
decrease overall technology spending, adversely affecting demand for our products, our business and the value of our common stock.
The global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. The ultimate impact
of  the  COVID-19  pandemic  or  a  similar  health  epidemic  is  highly  uncertain  and  subject  to  change.  The  extent  of  the  impact  of  the  COVID-19
pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time
frame, will depend on future developments, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the actions to contain
the disease or treat its impact, related restrictions on travel, and the duration, timing and severity of the impact on customer spending, including any
recession resulting from the pandemic, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. An extended period of global supply chain and economic
disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material negative impact on our business, results of operations, access to sources of
liquidity and financial condition, though the full extent and duration is uncertain.
Business disruptions could harm our business, lead to a decline in revenue and increase our costs.
Our  worldwide  operations  could  be  disrupted  by  earthquakes,  telecommunications  failures,  power  or  water  shortages,  outages  at  cloud  service
providers,  tsunamis,  floods,  hurricanes,  typhoons,  fires,  extreme  weather  conditions,  cyber-attacks,  terrorist  attacks,  medical  epidemics  or
pandemics  (including,  but  not  limited  to,  COVID-19)  and  other  natural  or  man-made  disasters,  catastrophic  events  or  climate  change.  The
occurrence of any of these disruptions could harm our business and result in significant losses, a decline in revenue and an increase in our costs
and expenses. Any of these business disruptions could require substantial expenditures and recovery time in order to fully resume operations. Such
risks  are discussed  further  in the risk factor  “The  recent  novel coronavirus  (COVID-19)  pandemic  could materially  adversely  affect  our financial
condition and results of operations.” Our corporate headquarters, and a portion of our research and development activities, are located in California,
and other critical business operations, finished goods inventory, and some of our suppliers are located in Asia, near major earthquake faults known
for seismic activity. In addition, a large portion of our current data center capacity is located in California, making our operations vulnerable to natural
disasters or other business disruptions occurring in these geographical areas. The manufacture of product
30

---
components, the final assembly of our products and other critical operations are concentrated in certain geographic locations, including Taiwan,
China, Hong Kong, and Korea. Additionally, a significant portion of our finished goods product distribution occurs through Hong Kong. Geopolitical
change or changes in government regulations and policies in the United States or abroad may result in changing regulatory requirements, trade
policies, import duties and economic disruptions that could impact our operating strategies, product demand, access to global markets, hiring, and
profitability. In particular, revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement could result in increased taxation, trade sanctions,
the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions and controls on imports or exports, or other retaliatory actions, which could have an adverse
effect on our business plans. For example, regulations to implement the Export Control Reform Act of 2018 could have an adverse effect on our
business  plans.  Catastrophic  events  can  also  have  an  impact  on  third-party  vendors  who  provide  us  critical  infrastructure  services  for  IT  and
research and development systems and personnel. Our operations could be harmed if manufacturing, logistics or other operations in these locations
are  disrupted  for  any  reason,  including  natural  disasters,  high  heat  events  or  water  shortages,  information  technology  system  failures,  military
actions or economic, business, labor, environmental, public health, regulatory or political issues. The ultimate impact on us, our third-party foundries
and other suppliers and our general infrastructure of being located near major earthquake faults and being consolidated in certain geographical
areas is unknown. In the event a major earthquake or other disaster or catastrophic event affects us or the third-party systems on which we rely, our
business  could  be  harmed  as  a  result  of  declines  in  revenue,  increases  in  expenses,  substantial  expenditures  and  time  spent  to  fully  resume
operations.
We are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with international operations, which may harm our business.
We  conduct  our  business  worldwide  and  we  have  offices  in  various  countries  outside  of  the  United  States.  Our  semiconductor  wafers  are
manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States. We also generate a significant portion of our
revenue from sales outside the United States. We allocate revenue to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially
billed even if our customers’ revenue is attributable to end customers that are located in a different location. Revenue from sales outside of the
United States accounted for 84% and 93% of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively Revenue from billings to
China, including Hong Kong, was 25% of our revenue for the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, even if our customers' revenue is attributable to end
customers that are located in a different location. Additionally, as of April 26, 2020, approximately 46% of our employees were located outside of the
United States. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on
our business, financial condition and results of operations, including:
•
international economic and political conditions, including as a result of the United Kingdom's vote to withdraw from the European Union, and
other political tensions between countries in which we do business;
•
unexpected changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in tax laws;
•
differing legal standards with respect to protection of intellectual property and employment practices;
•
local business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited
from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anticorruption laws and regulations;
•
exporting or importing issues related to export or import restrictions, including deemed export restrictions, tariffs, quotas and other trade
barriers and restrictions;
•
disruptions of capital and trading markets and currency fluctuations;
•
increased costs due to imposition of climate change regulations, such as carbon taxes, fuel or energy taxes, and pollution limits; and
•
natural disasters, public health issues (including the COVID-19 pandemic discussed further in the risk factor “The recent novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) pandemic could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations,” above), and other catastrophic
events.
If our sales outside of the United States are delayed or cancelled because of any of the above factors, our revenue may be negatively impacted.
Adverse changes in global or regional economic conditions, including recession or slowing growth, changes or uncertainty in fiscal, monetary, or
trade policy, higher interest rates, tighter credit, inflation, lower capital expenditures
31

---
by businesses including on IT infrastructure, increases in unemployment, and lower consumer confidence and spending, periodically occur. The
COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty. It is likely that the continued spread of COVID-19 will cause an
economic slowdown, and it is possible that it could cause a global recession. Adverse changes in economic conditions, including as a result of the
pandemic,  can  significantly  harm  demand  for  our  products  and  make  it  more  challenging  to  forecast  our  operating  results  and  make  business
decisions,  including  regarding  prioritization  of  investments  in  our  business.  An  economic  downturn  or  increased  uncertainty  may  also  lead  to
increased credit and collectability risks, higher borrowing costs or reduced availability of capital markets, reduced liquidity, adverse impacts on our
suppliers,  failures  of  counterparties  including  financial  institutions  and  insurers,  asset  impairments,  and  declines  in  the  value  of  our  financial
instruments.
We may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions or strategic investments, including the
Mellanox  acquisition,  and  we  may  not  be  able  to  successfully  integrate  acquisition  targets,  which  could  hurt  our  ability  to  grow  our
business, develop new products or sell our products.
We  have  in  the  past  acquired  and  invested  in,  and  may  continue  to  acquire  and  invest  in,  other  businesses  that  offer  products,  services  and
technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing products, strategic objectives and business. We completed our acquisition of
Mellanox  for  approximately  $7.0  billion on April 27, 2020.  The Mellanox  acquisition  and other  past  or future  acquisitions  or  investments  involve
significant challenges and risks, and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products, and ultimately could
have  a  negative  impact  on  our  growth  or  our  financial  results.  Given  that  our  resources  are  limited,  our  decision  to  pursue  a  transaction  has
opportunity costs; accordingly, if we pursue a particular transaction, we may need to forgo the prospect of entering into other transactions that could
help us achieve our strategic objectives. Additional risks related to the Mellanox acquisition, and other acquisitions or strategic investments include,
but are not limited to:
•
difficulty in combining the technology, products, operations or workforce of the acquired business with our business;
•
diversion of capital and other resources, including management’s attention;
•
assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;
•
integrating financial forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;
•
coordinating and integrating operations in countries in which we have not previously operated;
•
difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return, if at all;
•
difficulty in obtaining regulatory, other approvals or financing;
•
failure and costs associated with the failure to consummate a proposed acquisition or other strategic investment;
•
legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;
•
uncertainties and time needed to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;
•
negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;
•
the need to later divest acquired assets if an acquisition does not meet our expectations;
•
potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the acquired assets or company; and
•
impairment  of  relationships  with,  or  loss  of  our  or  our  target’s,  employees,  vendors  and  customers,  as  a  result  of  our  acquisition  or
investment.
Our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from implementing our strategy or fulfilling our contractual
obligations.
In September 2016, we issued $2.00 billion of the September 2016 Notes. In March 2020, we issued $5.00 billion of the March 2020 Notes.
32

---
Our indebtedness may limit our ability to use our cash flow or borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and
general corporate and other purposes. Additionally, our obligation to make payments related to the Notes could impact our cash balance and limit
our ability to use our cash for our capital return program and our other liquidity needs, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions,
investments and other general corporate purposes.
ITEM 2. UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES AND USE OF PROCEEDS
Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities
Beginning August 2004, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase our stock.
Since the inception of our share repurchase  program,  we have repurchased  an aggregate  of 260 million shares  for  a total cost of $7.08 billion
through April 26, 2020. All shares delivered from these repurchases have been placed into treasury stock.
The repurchases can be made in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions, or in structured share repurchase programs, and can be
made in one or more larger repurchases. The program does not obligate NVIDIA to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program
may be suspended at any time at our discretion.
In the first quarter of fiscal year 2021, we returned $98 million in quarterly cash dividends. As of April 26, 2020, we were authorized, subject to
certain specifications, to repurchase additional shares of our common stock up to $7.24 billion through December 2022. We did not repurchase any
shares  during  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2021.  Due  to  the  current  market  uncertainties,  we  are  evaluating  the  timing  of  resuming  share
repurchases and will remain nimble based on market conditions. We remain committed to paying quarterly dividends.
Restricted Stock Unit Share Withholding
We also withhold common stock shares associated with net share settlements to cover tax withholding obligations upon the vesting of restricted
stock  unit  awards  under  our  employee  equity  incentive  program.  During  the  first  quarter  of  fiscal  year  2021,  we  withheld  approximately  1
million shares at a total cost of $222 million through net share settlements.  Refer to Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements for further discussion regarding our equity incentive plans.

Attachment I
NVIDIA Corporation
Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan
Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
Pursuant to the Global Restricted Stock Unit Grant Notice (“ Grant Notice ”) and this Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
(including  any  additional  terms  and  conditions  for  your  country  set  forth  in  the  appendix  attached  hereto  (the  “ Appendix ”))
(collectively,  the  “ Agreement ”),  NVIDIA  Corporation  (the  “ Company ”)  has  awarded  you  a  Restricted  Stock  Unit  Award  (the
“ Award ”) under its Amended & Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Plan (the “ Plan ”). This Award is granted to you effective as of the
date of grant set forth in the Grant Notice (the “ Date of Grant ”). Capitalized terms not explicitly defined in this Agreement will have
the same meanings given to them in the Plan.
1.
Grant of the Award.  The Award represents the right to be issued on a future date one share of Common Stock for
each Restricted Stock Unit that vests under this Award, subject to the terms and conditions provided in this Agreement and in the
Plan. As of the Date of Grant, the Company will credit to a bookkeeping account maintained by the Company for your benefit (the
“ Account ”) the number of Restricted Stock Units subject to the Award. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, you will not
be required to make any payment to the Company with respect to your receipt of the Award, the vesting of the Restricted Stock Units
or the delivery of the underlying Common Stock.
2.
Vesting.  Subject to the limitations contained in this Agreement, your Award will vest, if at all, in accordance with the
vesting schedule provided in the Grant Notice, including any special acceleration provisions, as applicable, contained in the Grant
Notice. Vesting will cease upon the termination of your Continuous Service, except if termination is by reason of death, in which
case vesting will accelerate as described in the Grant Notice (and subject to any other acceleration provided for in the Grant Notice
or the Plan). On the termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason other than death), the Restricted Stock Units credited to
the Account that were not vested on the date of such termination (and are not accelerated pursuant to any acceleration provided for in
the Grant Notice or the Plan) will be forfeited and returned to the Company at no cost to the Company and you will have no further
right, title or interest in or to such Restricted Stock Units or the underlying shares of Common Stock.
3.
Number of Restricted Stock Units and Shares of Common Stock.
(a)
The number of Restricted Stock Units (and the related shares of Common Stock) subject to your Award will
be adjusted from time to time for Capitalization Adjustments, as provided in the Plan.
(b)
Any Restricted Stock Units, shares, cash or other property that become subject to the Award as a result of a
Capitalization Adjustment, if any, will be subject to the
1.

---
same forfeiture restrictions, restrictions on transferability, and time and manner of delivery as applicable to the other shares covered
by your Award.
(c)
No fractional shares or rights for fractional shares of Common Stock will be created by this Section 3. The
Board will round down, to the nearest whole share or whole unit of rights, any fractional shares or rights for fractional shares.
4.
Compliance  with  Law.  You  will  not  be  issued  any  shares  under  your  Award  unless  either  (a)  the  shares  are
registered under the Securities Act; or (b) the Company has determined that such issuance would be exempt from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act. Your Award also must comply with other applicable laws and regulations governing the Award,
including any U.S. and non-U.S. state, federal and local laws, and you will not receive such shares if the Company determines that
such receipt would not be in material compliance with such laws and regulations.
5.
Limitations on Transfer.  Your Award is not transferable, except by will or by the laws of descent and distribution.
In addition to any other limitation on transfer created by applicable securities or other laws, you agree not to assign, hypothecate,
donate, encumber or otherwise dispose of any interest in any of the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award until the shares
are issued to you. After the shares have been issued to you, you are free to assign, hypothecate, donate, encumber or otherwise
dispose of any interest in such shares provided that any such actions are in compliance with the provisions in this Agreement and
applicable securities or other laws. If permitted by the Board and valid under applicable law, you may, by delivering written notice to
the Company, in a form satisfactory to the Company, designate a third party who, in the event of your death, will thereafter be
entitled  to  receive  any  distribution  of  Common  Stock  to  which  you  were  entitled  at  the  time  of  your  death  pursuant  to  this
Agreement.
6.
Date of Issuance.
(a)
The issuance of shares of Common Stock in respect of the Restricted Stock Units is intended to comply with
Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and will be construed and administered in such a manner to the extent applicable.
(b)
Subject to the satisfaction of any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10 of
this Agreement), in the event one or more Restricted Stock Units vests, the Company will issue to you, on the applicable vesting
date, one share of Common Stock for each Restricted Stock Unit that vests and such issuance date is referred to as the “ Original
Issuance Date .” If the Original Issuance Date falls on a date that is not a business day, delivery will instead occur on the next
following business day.
(c)
However,  if  (i) the Original Issuance Date does not occur (1) during an “open window period” applicable to
you, as determined by the Company in accordance with the Company’s then-effective policy on trading in Company securities, or
(2) on a date when you are otherwise permitted to sell shares of Common Stock on an established stock exchange or stock market
(including but not limited to under a previously established Company-approved 10b5-1
2.

---
trading plan),  and  (ii) the Company elects, prior to the Original Issuance Date, (1) not to satisfy any withholding obligations for Tax-
Related Items (as defined in Section 10 below) by withholding shares of Common Stock from the shares otherwise due, on the
Original Issuance Date, to you under this Award, (2) not to permit you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-
dealer pursuant to this Agreement (including but not limited to a commitment under a previously established Company-approved
10b5-1 trading plan) and (3) not to permit you to cover any withholding obligations for Tax-Related Items (as defined in Section 10
below) in cash,  then  the shares that would otherwise be issued to you on the Original Issuance Date will not be delivered on such
Original Issuance Date and will instead be delivered on the first business day when you are not prohibited from selling shares of the
Company’s Common Stock in the open public market, but in no event later than December 31 of the calendar year in which the
Original Issuance Date occurs (that is, the last day of your taxable year in which the Original Issuance Date occurs), or, if and only if
permitted in a manner that complies with Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(b)(4), no later than the date that is the 15th day of
the third calendar month of the year following the year in which the shares of Common Stock under this Award are no longer subject
to a “substantial risk of forfeiture” within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-1(d). The form of such delivery of
the shares ( e.g. , a stock certificate or electronic entry evidencing such shares) shall be determined by the Company.
7.
Dividends.  You will receive no benefit or adjustment to your Award and any unissued shares thereunder with respect
to any cash dividend, stock dividend or other distribution that does not result from a Capitalization Adjustment. Following the date
of  vesting,  in  the  event  of  any  cash  dividend,  stock  dividend  or  other  distribution  that  does  not  result  from  a  Capitalization
Adjustment,  no  cash,  stock  or  other  property  related  to  such  dividend  or  distribution  will  be  issuable  in  respect  of  your  vested
Restricted Stock Units.
8.
Restrictive Legends.  The  shares  of  Common  Stock  issued  under  your  Award  will  be  endorsed  with  appropriate
legends if determined by the Company that legends are required under applicable law or otherwise.
9.
Award not a Service Contract.
(a)
Your Continuous Service with the Company or, if different, the Affiliate that employs you or for which you
otherwise render services (the " Service Recipient  ") is not for any specified term and may be terminated by you or by the Service
Recipient at any time, for any reason, with or without cause and, if permitted under applicable law, with or without notice. Nothing
in this Agreement (including, but not limited to, the vesting of your Award pursuant to the schedule set forth in the Grant Notice or
the issuance of the shares subject to your Award), the Plan or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found implicit
in  this  Agreement  or  the  Plan  will:  (i)  confer  upon  you  any  right  to  continue  in  the  employ  of,  or  affiliation  with  the  Service
Recipient; (ii) constitute any promise or commitment by the Company, the Service Recipient or any other Affiliate regarding the fact
or  nature  of  future  positions,  future  work  assignments,  future  compensation  or  any  other  term  or  condition  of  employment  or
affiliation; (iii) confer any right or benefit under this Agreement or the Plan unless such right or benefit has specifically accrued
under the terms of this Agreement or Plan;
3.

---
or (iv) deprive the Service Recipient of the right to terminate you at any time and without regard to any future vesting opportunity
that you may have. The grant of the Award shall not be interpreted as forming or amending an employment or service contract with
the Company or the Service Recipient.
(b)
By accepting this Award, you acknowledge and agree that the right to continue vesting in the Award is earned
only through Continuous Service (not through the act of being hired, being granted this Award or any other award or benefit) and
that the Company has the right to reorganize, sell, spin-out or otherwise restructure one or more of its businesses or Affiliates at any
time  or  from  time  to  time,  as  it  deems  appropriate  (a  “ reorganization ”).  You  further  acknowledge  and  agree  that  such  a
reorganization  could  result  in  the  termination  of  your  Continuous  Service,  or  the  termination  of  Affiliate  status  of  the  Service
Recipient and the loss of benefits available to you under this Agreement, including but not limited to, the termination of the right to
continue vesting in the Award. You further acknowledge and agree that this Agreement, the Plan, the transactions contemplated
hereunder and the vesting schedule set forth in this Agreement or any covenant of good faith and fair dealing that may be found
implicit in any of them do not constitute an express or implied promise of continued engagement as an Employee or Consultant for
the term of this Agreement, for any period, or at all, and will not interfere in any way with your right or the right of the Service
Recipient to terminate your Continuous Service at any time, with or without cause and, if permitted under applicable law, with or
without notice, and will not interfere in any way with the Company’s right to conduct a reorganization.
10.
Responsibility for Taxes.
(a)
You acknowledge that, regardless of any action the Company or the Service Recipient   takes with respect to
any or all income tax, social insurance, payroll tax, fringe benefit tax, payment on account or other tax related items related to your
participation in the Plan and legally applicable to you (“ Tax-Related Items ”), the ultimate liability for all Tax-Related Items is and
remains your responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the Company or the Service Recipient, if any. You
further  acknowledge  that  the  Company  and/or  the  Service  Recipient  (i)  make  no  representations  or  undertakings  regarding  the
treatment of any Tax-Related Items in connection with any aspect of your Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the
grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the vesting and settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the delivery or sale of any shares of
Common Stock and the issuance of any dividends, and (ii) do not commit to and are under no obligation to structure the terms of the
grant or any aspect of your Award to reduce or eliminate your liability for Tax-Related Items or achieve any particular tax result.
You acknowledge and agree that you will not make any claim against the Company, or any of its Officers, Directors, Employees or
Affiliates  (including  the  Service  Recipient)  for  Tax-Related  Items  arising  from  your  Award.  Further,  if  you  are  subject  to  Tax-
Related Items in more than one jurisdiction, you acknowledge that the Company and/or the Service Recipient may be required to
withhold or account for Tax-Related Items in more than one jurisdiction.
4.

---
(b)
Prior to the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, you agree to make adequate arrangements
satisfactorily  to  the  Company,  and/or  the  Service  Recipient  to  satisfy  all  Tax-Related  Items.  In  this  regard,  you  authorize  the
Company and/or the Service Recipient, or their respective agents, at their discretion, to satisfy their withholding obligations, if any,
with regard to all Tax-Related Items by one or a combination of the following: (i) withholding from your wages or any other cash
compensation otherwise payable to you by the Company and/or the Service Recipient; (ii) causing you to tender a cash payment; (iii)
permitting or requiring you to enter into a “same day sale” commitment with a broker-dealer that is a member of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (a “ FINRA Dealer ”) (if required, pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) whereby
you irrevocably elect to sell a portion of the shares to be delivered upon settlement of your Restricted Stock Units to satisfy the Tax-
Related Items and whereby the FINRA Dealer irrevocably commits to forward the proceeds necessary to satisfy the withholding
obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  directly  to  the  Company  and/or  the  Service  Recipient,  including  a  commitment  pursuant  to  a
previously  established  Company-approved  10b5-1  plan,  and/or  (iv)  withholding  shares  of  Common  Stock  from  the  shares  of
Common  Stock  issued  or  otherwise  issuable  to  you  upon  settlement  of  the  Award  with  a  value  equal  to  the  amount  of  such
withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items or such other amount as may be permitted while still avoiding classification of the
Award as a liability for financial accounting purposes;  provided, however  that if you are an Officer, then the Company will withhold
a number of shares of Common Stock upon the relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, unless the use of such
withholding method is not feasible under applicable law or has materially adverse accounting consequences, as determined by the
Board,  in  its  sole  discretion,  in  which  case,  any  withholding  obligation  for  Tax-Related  Items  may  be  satisfied  by  one  or  a
combination of methods (i)-(iii) above.
(c)
The Company and/or the Service Recipient may withhold or account for Tax-Related Items by considering
applicable minimum statutory withholding amounts or other applicable withholding rates, including maximum rates applicable in
your jurisdiction(s), in which case you may receive a refund of any over-withheld amount in cash and will have no entitlement to the
Common Stock equivalent. Maximum tax rates are based on the applicable rates in your country, including your share of payroll or
similar taxes, as provided in tax law, regulations, or the tax authority’s administrative practices, not to exceed the highest rate in that
jurisdiction, even if that rate exceeds the highest rate that may be applicable to you. If any withholding obligation for Tax-Related
Items is satisfied by withholding a number of shares of Common Stock, for tax purposes, you will be deemed to have been issued the
full number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the shares of
Common Stock is held back solely for the purpose of paying the Tax-Related Items.
(d)
Unless any withholding obligation for Tax-Related Items is satisfied, the Company will have no obligation to
deliver to you any shares of Common Stock or other consideration pursuant to this Award.
(e)
In the event any obligation to withhold arises prior to the delivery to you of shares of Common Stock or it is
determined after the delivery of shares of Common Stock to
5.

---
you  that  the  amount  of  the  withholding  obligation  was  greater  than  the  amount  withheld,  you  agree  to  indemnify  and  hold  the
Company  and/or the Service Recipient harmless from any failure by the Company  and/or the Service Recipient  to withhold  the
proper amount.
11.
Nature of Grant.  In accepting your Award, you acknowledge, understand and agree that:
(a)
the  Plan  is  established  voluntarily  by  the  Company,  it  is  discretionary  in  nature  and  it  may  be  modified,
amended, suspended or terminated by the Company at any time, to the extent permitted by the Plan;

in the past;
(c)
all decisions with respect to future Awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion of the Company;
(d)
you are voluntarily participating in the Plan;
(e)
the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award, and the income from and value of same, are

payments under any employee benefit plan sponsored by the Company or any Affiliate, except as such plan otherwise expressly
provides (and the Company expressly reserves its rights to amend, modify, or terminate any of the Company’s or any Affiliate’s
employee benefit plans);
(h)
the  future  value  of  the  underlying  shares  of  Common  Stock  is  unknown,  indeterminable,  and  cannot  be
predicted with certainty;
(i)
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Award resulting from the
termination of your Continuous Service (for any reason except for your death and whether or not later found to be invalid or in
breach  of employment  laws  in  the  jurisdiction  where  you  are  employed  or rendering  services  or  the  terms  of  your  employment
agreement, if any);
6.

---
(j)
unless otherwise provided herein, in the Plan or by the Company in its discretion, the Award and the benefits
evidenced by this Agreement do not create any entitlement to have the Award or any such benefits transferred to, or assumed by,
another  company  nor  to  be  exchanged,  cashed  out  or  substituted  for,  in  connection  with  any  corporate  transaction  affecting  the
shares of Common Stock;
(k)
unless otherwise agreed with the Company, the Award and the shares of Common Stock subject to the Award,
and the income from and value of same, are not granted as consideration for, or in connection with, the service you may provide as a
director of an Affiliate; and
(l)
if you are in Continuous Service outside the United States:

amounts due to you pursuant to the vesting of the Award or the subsequent sale of any shares of Common Stock acquired upon
settlement.
12.
No Advice Regarding Grant.  The Company is not providing any tax, legal or financial advice, nor is the Company
making  any  recommendations  regarding  your  participation  in  the  Plan,  or  your  acquisition  or  sale  of  the  underlying  shares  of
Common Stock. You should consult with your own personal tax, financial and/or legal advisors regarding your participation in the
Plan, and by accepting this Award, you have agreed that you have done so or knowingly and voluntarily declined to do so.

Unsecured Obligation.  Your Award is unfunded, and as a holder of an Award, you will be considered an unsecured
creditor of the Company with respect to the Company’s obligation, if any, to issue shares pursuant to this Agreement upon vesting of
the Award. You will not have voting or any other rights as a stockholder of the Company with respect to the shares to be issued
pursuant to this Agreement until such shares are issued to you. Upon such issuance, you will obtain full voting and other rights as a
stockholder of the Company. Nothing contained in this Agreement, and no action taken pursuant to its provisions, will create or be
construed to create a trust of any kind or a fiduciary relationship between you and the Company or any other person.
14.
Other Documents . You hereby acknowledge receipt or the right to receive a document providing the information
required by Rule 428(b)(1) promulgated under the Securities Act, which includes the Plan prospectus. In addition, you acknowledge

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver any documents and transmit or require you

16.
Governing Plan Document/Recoupment.  Your Award is subject to all the provisions of the Plan, the provisions of
which are hereby made a part of your Award, and is further subject to all interpretations, amendments, rules and regulations which
may from time to time be promulgated and adopted pursuant to the Plan. In addition, this Award (and any shares issued under this
Award) is subject to recoupment in accordance with the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and any
implementing  regulations  thereunder,  any  clawback  policy  adopted  by  the  Company  and  any  compensation  recovery  policy

17.
Language.  You acknowledge that you are sufficiently proficient in the English language, or have consulted with an
advisor  who  is  sufficiently  proficient  in  English,  so  as  to  allow  you  to  understand  the  terms  and  conditions  of  this  Agreement.

18.
Insider Trading Restrictions/Market Abuse Laws.  You may be subject to insider trading restrictions and/or market
abuse laws based on the exchange on which the shares of Common Stock are listed and in applicable jurisdictions, including the
United  States  and  your  country  or  your  broker’s  country,  if  different,  which  may  affect  your  ability  to  accept,  acquire,  sell  or
otherwise dispose of shares of Common Stock, rights to shares of Common Stock (e.g., Restricted Stock Units) or rights linked to
the value of shares of Common Stock during such times as you are considered to have “inside information” regarding the Company
(as  defined  by  the  laws  in  applicable  jurisdictions).  Local  insider  trading  laws  and  regulations  may  prohibit  the  cancellation  or
amendment of orders you placed before you possessed inside information. Furthermore, you could be prohibited from (i) disclosing
the  inside  information  to  any  third  party,  which  may  include  fellow  employees  and  (ii)  “tipping”  third  parties  or  causing  them
otherwise  to  buy  or  sell  securities.  Any  restrictions  under  these  laws  or  regulations  are  separate  from  and  in  addition  to  any
restrictions  that  may  be  imposed  under  any  applicable  insider  trading  policy  of  the  Company.  You  acknowledge  that  it  is  your
responsibility to comply with any applicable restrictions and you should speak with your personal legal advisor on this matter.
19.

account and/or tax reporting requirements and exchange
8.

controls which may affect your ability to acquire or hold shares of Common Stock under the Plan or cash received from participating
in the Plan (including from any dividends received or sale proceeds arising from the sale of shares of Common Stock) in a brokerage
or bank account outside your country. You understand that you may be required to report such accounts, assets or transactions to the
tax or other authorities in your country. You also may be required to repatriate sale proceeds or other funds received as a result of
participation in the Plan to your country through a designated bank or broker and/or within a certain time after receipt. In addition,
you may be subject to tax payment and/or reporting obligations in connection with any income realized under the Plan and/or from
the sale of shares of Common Stock. You acknowledge that you are responsible for complying with all such requirements, and that
you should consult personal legal and tax advisors, as applicable, to ensure compliance.
20.
Appendix.  Notwithstanding any provisions in this Agreement, your Award shall be subject to the additional terms
and conditions for your country set forth in the Appendix attached hereto as  Attachment II . Moreover, if you relocate to one of the
countries included therein, the terms and conditions for such country will apply to you to the extent the Company determines that the
application of such terms and conditions is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons. The Appendix constitutes part
of this Agreement.
21.
Imposition  of  Other  Requirements.  The  Company  reserves  the  right  to  impose  other  requirements  on  your
participation in the Plan, on the Award and on any shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan, to the extent the Company
determines it is necessary or advisable for legal or administrative reasons.
22.
Severability.  If all or any part of this Agreement or the Plan is declared by any court or governmental authority to be
unlawful or invalid, such unlawfulness or invalidity will not invalidate any portion of this Agreement or the Plan not declared to be
unlawful or invalid. Any Section of this Agreement (or part of such a Section) so declared to be unlawful or invalid will, if possible,
be construed in a manner which will give effect to the terms of such Section or part of a Section to the fullest extent possible while
remaining lawful and valid.
23.
Governing Law/Venue.  The interpretation, performance and enforcement of this Agreement will be governed by the

consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the State of California and agree that such litigation shall be conducted only in the courts of
Santa Clara County, California, or the federal courts for the United States for the Northern District of California, and no other courts,
where this grant is made and/or to be performed.
24.
Miscellaneous.
(a)  The rights and obligations of the Company under your Award will be transferable to any one or more persons or
entities, and all covenants and agreements hereunder will inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Company’s successors
and assigns. Your
9.

---
rights and obligations under your Award may only be assigned with the prior written consent of the Company.
(b)  You  agree  upon  request  to  execute  any  further  documents  or  instruments  necessary  or  desirable  in  the  sole
determination of the Company to carry out the purposes or intent of your Award.
(c)  You acknowledge and agree that you have reviewed your Award in its entirety, have had an opportunity to obtain
the advice of counsel prior to executing and accepting your Award, and fully understand all provisions of your Award.
(d)  All  obligations  of  the  Company  under  the  Plan  and  this  Agreement  will  be  binding  on  any  successor  to  the
Company, whether the existence of such successor is the result of a direct or indirect purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise,
of all or substantially all of the business and/or assets of the Company.
25.
Amendment.  Subject to Section 21 above, this Agreement may not be modified, amended or terminated except by an
instrument in writing, signed by you and by a duly authorized representative of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this
Agreement may be amended solely by the Board by a writing which specifically states that it is amending this Agreement, so long as
a copy of such amendment is delivered to you, and provided that no such amendment adversely affecting your rights hereunder may
be made without your written consent. Without limiting the foregoing, the Board reserves the right to change, by written notice to
you, the provisions of this Agreement in any way it may deem necessary or advisable to carry out the purpose of the grant as a result
of any change in applicable laws or regulations or any future law, regulation, ruling, or judicial decision, provided that any such
change will be applicable only to rights relating to that portion of the Award which is then subject to restrictions as provided in this
Agreement.
26.
Compliance with Section 409A of the Code .   This Award is intended to comply with U.S. Treasury Regulation
Section 1.409A-1(b)(4) and thus to not be treated as “deferred compensation”, and will be construed and administered in such a
manner, and any ambiguous or missing terms that may otherwise be supplied from and/or defined under Code Section 409A in a
manner that fulfills such intention hereby incorporated by reference. Each installment of Restricted Stock Units that vests hereunder
is intended to constitute a “separate payment” for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if it is determined that the Award fails to satisfy the requirements of the short-term deferral rule and is otherwise not
exempt  from,  and  determined  to  be  deferred  compensation  subject  to  Code  Section  409A,  this  Award  shall  comply  with  Code
Section 409A to the extent necessary to avoid adverse personal tax consequences and any ambiguities herein shall be interpreted
accordingly. If it is determined that the Award is deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A and you are a “specified
employee” (as determined under Code Section 409A) on your Separation from Service, then the issuance of any shares, cash or other
property that would otherwise be made on the date of your Separation from Service (or within the first six months thereafter as a
result of your Separation from Service) will not be made on the originally scheduled date(s) and will instead be issued in a lump sum
on the date that is six months and one
10.

---
day after the date of the Separation from Service, but if and only if such delay in the issuance is necessary to avoid the imposition of
taxation on you in respect of the shares, cash or property under Code Section 409A.

Attachment II
Appendix to
NVIDIA Corporation
Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement
Additional Terms and Conditions For Non-U.S. Participants
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Appendix have the meanings set forth in the Plan, in the Global Restricted Stock Unit
Grant Notice and/or in the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement.
Terms and Conditions
This Appendix includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Restricted Stock Units granted to you under the Plan if you
reside and/or work in one of the countries listed below. If you are a citizen or resident (or are considered as such for local law
purposes) of a country  other than the country in which you are currently  residing and/or working,  or if you relocate  to another
country after the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, the Company shall, in its discretion, determine to what extent the additional
terms and conditions contained herein shall be applicable to you.
Notifications
This Appendix may also include information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which you should be aware
with respect to your participation in the Plan. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other laws in effect in
the respective countries as of January 2020. Such laws are often complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly
recommends that you not rely on the information in this Appendix as the only source of information relating to the consequences of

purpose  of  performing  its  contractual  obligations  under  this  Agreement,  granting  Restricted  Stock  Units,  implementing,
administering and managing your participation in the Plan and facilitating compliance with applicable tax, exchange control,
securities and labor law. The legal basis for the processing of the Personal Data (as defined below) by the Company and the
third-party service providers described below is the necessity of the data processing for the Company to perform its contractual

administering employee equity awards.

necessary to ensure compliance with applicable tax, exchange control, securities and labor law. Such third party service providers
may  include  the  Company’s  outside  legal  counsel  as  well  as  the  Company’s  auditor.  Wherever  possible,  the  Company  will
anonymize data, but you understand that your Personal Data may need to be transferred to such providers to ensure compliance
with applicable law and/or tax requirements.

adequacy finding by the European Commission and that your Personal Data may not have an equivalent level of protection as
compared to your country of residence.

Framework  and  Swiss-U.S.  Privacy  Shield  Framework  as  set  forth  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Commerce  regarding  the
collection, use, and retention of Personal Data transferred from the European Union and Switzerland to the United States. The
Company has certified to the Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.
If  there  is  any  conflict  between  the  terms  in  this  Agreement  and  the  Privacy  Shield  Principles,  the  Privacy  Shield
Principles shall govern. To learn more about the Privacy Shield program, and to view the Company’s certification, please visit
www.privacyshield.gov.

and manage your participation in the Plan, or as required to comply with legal or regulatory obligations, including tax, exchange
control, labor and securities laws.

it was collected, or does not need to be retained by the Company for other legitimate purposes;
iv. Restrict or object to the processing of your Personal Data; and
v. If applicable, request your Personal Data be ported (transferred) to another company.
Subject to the applicable data protection laws, application of the above rights may vary depending on the type of data
involved, and the Company’s particular basis for processing the Personal Data.
To make a request to exercise one of the above rights, you can contact your local HR representative. The Company will
consider  and  act  upon  any  requests  in  accordance  with  applicable  data  protection  laws.  The  Company  may  request  specific
information from you to enable it to confirm your identity and right to access, as well as to search for and provide you with the
Personal Data that it holds about you.
(h)  Contractual  Requirement .  Your  provision  of  Personal  Data  and  its  processing  as  described  above  is  a
contractual requirement and a condition to your ability to participate in the Plan. You understand that, as a consequence of you
refusing to provide Personal Data, the Company may not be able to allow you to participate in the Plan, grant Restricted Stock
Units to you or administer or maintain such Restricted Stock Units. However, your participation in the Plan is purely voluntary.
While you will not receive Restricted Stock Units if you decide against participating in the Plan or providing Personal Data as
described above, your employment or other service and your salary or other cash compensation will not be affected in any way.
For  more  information  on  the  consequences  of  the  refusal  to  provide  Personal  Data,  you  may  contact  your  local  HR

legal proceedings entered into, given or instituted pursuant hereto or relating directly or indirectly hereto, be drawn up in English.
Les  parties  reconnaissent  avoir  exigé  la  rédaction  en  anglais  de  cette  convention  (“Agreement”),  ainsi  que  de  tous  documents
exécutés, avis donnés et procédures judiciaires intentées, directement ou indirectement, relativement à la présente convention.
Data Privacy . This provision supplements the Data Privacy Consent For Participants Working and/or Residing Outside the European
Union/European Economic Area provision of this Appendix:
You hereby authorize the Company and the Company’s representatives to discuss with and obtain all relevant information from all
personnel, professional or not, involved in the administration and operation of the Plan. You further authorize the Company, the

Common Stock are acquired, their cost generally is the adjusted cost base (“ACB”) of the shares. The ACB would ordinarily equal
the fair market value of the shares at the time of acquisition, but if you own other shares of the same company, this ACB may have to

time. You agree that the Company is authorized to instruct its designated broker to assist with the sale of such shares of Common
Stock (on your behalf pursuant to this authorization and without further consent) and you expressly authorize the designated broker
to complete the sale of such shares. You acknowledge that the designated broker is under no obligation to arrange for the sale of the
shares of Common Stock at any particular price. Upon the sale of the shares of Common Stock, the Company agrees to pay the cash

effectuated  through  a  special  exchange  control  account  established  by  the  Company  or  an  Affiliate  in  China.  If  the  funds  are
converted into local currency, neither the Company nor any Affiliate will bear the exchange rate risk and does not undertake to
convert the funds at any particular time or at any particular rate.
Exchange Control Requirements . You understand and agree that you will not be permitted to transfer any shares of Common Stock
acquired under the Plan out of the account established for you with the Company’s designated broker and that you will be required to
immediately repatriate to China any cash proceeds from the sale of the shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan or from
dividends paid on such shares. You further understand that such repatriation of cash proceeds will need to be effectuated through a
special exchange control account established by the Company or an Affiliate in China, and you hereby consent and agree that any
proceeds from the sale of shares of Common Stock or dividends paid on such shares may be transferred to such special account prior

such shares are paid and the time the proceeds are distributed to you through any such special account.

Exchange Control Information . The Czech National Bank (“ CNB ”) may require you to fulfill certain notification duties in relation to
the shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan or any dividends paid on such shares, and the opening and maintenance of a

personal  legal  advisor  prior  to  vesting  to  ensure  compliance  with  current  regulations.  It  is  your  responsibility  to  comply  with
applicable Czech exchange control laws.

Shares of Common Stock are financial instruments and
investing in shares of Common Stock will always have
financial risk. The possibility of profit at the time you sell
shares of Common Stock will not only be dependent on the
Company’s financial development, but also on the general
development of the stock market, among other things. The
future value of the shares of Common Stock is unknown,
indeterminable and cannot be predicted with certainty.
Ordinære Aktier er finansielle instrumenter, og investering i
Ordinære Aktier vil altid være forbundet med en økonomisk risiko.
Muligheden for en gevinst på det tidspunkt, hvor du sælger de
Ordinære Aktier, afhænger ikke alene af udviklingen i Selskabets
aktiekurs, men også af bl.a. den generelle udvikling på
aktiemarkedet. Den fremtidige værdi af de Ordinære Aktier kendes
ikke og kan ikke forudsiges med sikkerhed.

SPAIN
Terms and Conditions
Nature of Grant . The following provision supplements Section 11 of the Global Restricted Stock Unit Agreement:
By accepting the Award, you consent to participation in the Plan and acknowledge that you have received a copy of the Plan.
You understand that the Company has unilaterally, gratuitously and in its sole discretion decided to grant an Award under the Plan to
individuals who may be Consultants, Directors, or Employees of the Service Recipient, the Company, or one of its other Affiliates
throughout the world. The decision is limited and entered into based upon the express assumption and condition that any Award will
not economically or otherwise bind the Company or any Affiliate, including the Service Recipient, on an ongoing basis, other than as
expressly set forth in the Agreement. Consequently, you understand that the Award is given on the assumption and condition that the
Award shall not become part of any employment or other service contract (whether with the Company or any Affiliate, including the
Service Recipient) and shall not be considered a mandatory benefit, salary for any purpose (including severance compensation) or
any other right whatsoever. Furthermore, you understand and freely accept that there is no guarantee that any benefit whatsoever
shall arise from the Award, which is gratuitous and discretionary, since the future value of the Award, and the underlying shares of
Common Stock, is unknown and unpredictable.
Further, your participation in the Plan is expressly conditioned on your continued and active rendering of service, such that, unless
otherwise set forth in the Plan, if your Continuous Service
38.

terminates for any reason except for your death, your participation in the Plan will cease immediately. This will be the case, for
example, even if (1) you are considered to be unfairly dismissed without good cause ( i.e. , subject to a “ despido improcedente ”); (2)
you are dismissed for disciplinary or objective reasons or due to a collective dismissal; (3) your Continuous Service ceases due to a
change of work location, duties or any other employment or contractual condition; (4) your Continuous Service ceases due to a
unilateral breach of contract by the Company or any of its Affiliates; or (5) your Continuous Service terminates for any other reason
whatsoever. Consequently, upon termination of your Continuous Service for any of the above reasons, you automatically lose any
right to participate in the Plan on the date of your termination of Continuous Service, as described in the Plan and the Agreement.
Notifications
Securities Law Information .  The Award and shares of Common Stock described in the Agreement do not qualify under Spanish
regulations as securities.  No “offer of securities to the public”, as defined under Spanish law, has taken place or will take place in
the Spanish territory. The Agreement has not been nor will it be registered with the  Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores , and
does not constitute a public offering prospectus.
Exchange Control Information .   The acquisition of shares of Common Stock and subsequent sales of shares of Common Stock must
be  declared  for  statistical  purposes  to  the  Dirección  General  de  Comercio  e  Inversiones  (the  “  DGCI ”).  Because  you  will  not
purchase or sell the shares of Common Stock through the use of a Spanish financial institution, you will need to make the declaration
yourself by filing a D-6 form with the DGCI. Generally, the D-6 form must be filed each January while the shares of Common Stock
are owned. However, if the value of the shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan or the amount of the sale proceeds exceeds
€1,502,530, the declaration must be filed within one month of the acquisition or sale, as applicable.
In  addition,  any  securities  accounts  (including  brokerage  accounts  held  abroad),  as  well  as  the  securities  (including  shares  of
Common Stock) held in such accounts, may need to be declared electronically to the Bank of Spain, depending on the value of the
transactions during the prior tax year or the balances in such accounts as of December 31 of the prior tax year.
Foreign Asset/Account Reporting Information . Rights or assets ( e.g. , shares of Common Stock or cash held in a bank or brokerage
account) held outside of Spain with a value in excess of €50,000 per type of right or asset ( e.g. , shares of Common Stock, cash, etc.)
as of December 31, must be reported on your annual tax return.  After such rights and/or assets are initially reported, the reporting
obligation  will  only  apply  for  subsequent  years  if  the  value  of  any  previously-reported  rights  or  assets  increases  by  more  than
€20,000. Shares of Common Stock acquired under the Plan or other equity programs offered by the Company constitute assets for
purposes of this requirement, but unvested rights (e.g., Restricted Stock Units, etc.) are not considered assets or rights for purposes of
this requirement.

occurs may constitute an additional benefit to you on which additional income tax and National Insurance Contributions may be
